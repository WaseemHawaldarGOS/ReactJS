--using CRA
npx create-react-app demo


--without using CRA
Steps to setup without using CRA
Step1:
npm install --save-dev jest

Step2:
in package.json scripts add below entry
"test": "jest --watch"

Step3:
got to src, create file called as App.test.js and write test case to render component

*********************************************************************************************************************************

Excecute below command to run all test cases

npm test
The above command will run test case only if there is code change. change should be from last commit code. CRA automatically maps to git repo as well.

in watch mode in terminal
press a to run all tests
press q to quit watch mode
press o to run only last change

IMPORTANT NOTE: enzyme-adapter-react-17 not yet available
Create-React-App uses React 17, but Enzyme Adapter Not Yet Available
On October 23, 2020, create-react-app updated to React 17. Since running npx create-react-app as recommended in this course will use the latest version of create-react-app, your apps will be using React 17 as well.



What this means to you

Unfortunately, the official enzyme-adapter-react-17 is not yet available. Note that much of the course will work fine with enzyme-adapter-react-16, but you might see this error when using mount: 

TypeError: Cannot read property "child" of undefined



Unofficial adapter for React 17

Until the official adapter is released, you can use this unofficial adapter by running:

npm install --save-dev @wojtekmaj/enzyme-adapter-react-17
You will also need to import from this adapter: 

import Adapter from '@wojtekmaj/enzyme-adapter-react-17';
anywhere the course imports from enzyme-adapter-react-16.

There are some known issues with the unofficial adapter (it doesn't work with TypeScript), but it will fix some issues with using mount.



This should be a very temporary issue.

When the official adapter becomes available, I will update the lectures in this course to reflect this. Thanks!

--practicals on enzyme setup

npm install --save-dev enzyme jest-enzyme enzyme-adapter-react-16

note: use adapter version based on your react version

For react version 17, we need to use unofficial version of enzyme 17 using below command
npm install --save-dev @wojtekmaj/enzyme-adapter-react-17


The above command failed, we manually updated package.json and changed react version from 17 to 16. Because we want to use enzyme version as 16.9.0.


Refer https://enzymejs.github.io/enzyme/docs/api/shallow.html to know more on shallow methods that are available.

Steps to remove data-test-attributes from PROD build
====================================================

commands used in this section
npm install --save-dev babel-plugin-react-remove-properties

npm run eject
Note: code should be commited before we use the above command.
What npm eject does is it pulls our configuration properties and makes it editable to us.
If we look at package.json after the eject command is complete, we can see many more props added to it.

Now go and edit package.json and below lines in babel props
"env": {
    "production": {
      "plugins": [
        ["react-remove-properties", {"properties": ["data-test"]}]
      ]
    }
  }

npm run build
Note: this command is used for production build

sudo npm install -g server
Note: above command is to install server for PROD build command to run

server -s build
Note: this command is to serve app

Once we edit package.json to remove data-test-attributes using babel.

Once we bring up PROD app, inspect and see that data-test-attributes are no longer there.

See this link to know the babel props that we had used - https://www.npmjs.com/package/babel-plugin-react-remove-properties
