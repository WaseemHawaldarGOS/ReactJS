***********************************************Section 2***************************************
What is JSX?
Babel converts our normal html code that we write in React component(using JSX) to ES5 format or Javascript format which every browser understands.

See image - Babel-diagram.png

Visit Babeljs.io to see how babel converts jsx to javascript.
 See images - Babel-conversion1.png and Babel-conversion2.png
 
--------------------------------Difference between HTML and JSX code syntax-----------

We have 3 differences - Html-JSX-all-differences.png

-----Difference 1 - css styling syntax difference between HTML and JSX.

Go to codepen.io and type below code:
<div>
  <label class="label" for="name"> Enter name:</label>
  <input id="name" type="text"/>
  <button style="background-color:blue; color: white;">Submit</button>
</div>

See diagram - codepen-code.png

Create new react project for handson
command to create new project is - 
D:\JPMC-Data\Udemy trainings\Modern React with Redux 2020\workspace>npx create-react-app html-jsx-syntax-difference

Delete src contents and add contents as shown in project.

Now type same code in react component(App.js) and see if it works.
Error found - HTML-code-error.png

Syntax difference: 
<button style="background-color:blue; color: white;">Submit</button> 
has been changed to 
<button style={{backgroundColor:'blue', color: 'white'}}>Submit</button>
First curly brace indicates javascript variable and second one indicates javascript object.

----Difference 2 - Adding a class to element using different syntax

<label class="label" for="name"> Enter name:</label>
in JSX is
<label class="label" for="name"> Enter name:</label>

class is called className to differentiate between class component keyword.
It stills allows class as well as some flexibility and may be removed in future.

-----Difference 3: JSX can reference JS variables

See - Difference 3 component

-------------------How to fix html and jsx differences warning on our own--

Inspect Difference1 component and see that 'for' is 'htmlFor' in JSX. Just replace it with 'htmlFor' and test it.
See - console-inspect.png

3 topics in scope - Topics-in-scope.png
Mockup for this section - Mockup.png

Semantic UI CDN link - <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/semantic-ui/2.4.1/semantic.min.css">

Practicals - 
D:\JPMC-Data\Udemy trainings\Modern React with Redux 2020\workspace>npx create-react-app section-3-components

Remove all files from src and create App component in index.js

Next to integrate semantic ui in our project.
search for semantic cdn in google and open first link i.e. https://cdnjs.com/libraries/semantic-ui
Once open, click on css tab and scroll down or search for semantic.min.css and copy the url and paste it in index.html of our project.

To confirm that semantic css has been loaded. Observe the hello world text in div of App component will change it's font.
Another way to confirm is go to inspect and select network and click on css option. Reload page and see semantic css has been loaded.

Faker JS is used to create fake image, company, finance data or avatar.
Visit faker.js github to see the documentation.
-https://github.com/marak/Faker.js/

To add faker to our project, execute below command
npm install --save faker


********************************Section 4***********************************
Difference-betn-class-and-function-component.png

Earlier function component was only used to show JSX content and not play with lifecycle/state objects.
With newer version of react, functional components can also play with lifecycle and state. This is achieved with the help of hooks.
See - functional-component-with-hooks.png

When to use class and functional components in our project?

GeoLocation API link mentioned below has documentation on how to fetch geolocation using position object.
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Geolocation_API
Note: it is unavailable in china.

To see geolocation in code, go to console and observe
See -> my-geolocation.png

Once user says to allows to geolocation pop up, it will be always allowed.
To reset and ask again, click on the 'i' icon and say 'ask'.
See - how-to-reset-geolocation-preferences.png

******************************************Section 6 - Understanding Lifecycle methods*************

Lifecycle stages - Lifecycle-methods.png

Render method is used to only return JCX code and not do anything else.
ComponentDidMount gets invoked only once. It is best place to do data loading or location fetching.
Though constructor & ComponentDidMount both are best places to do component data loading kind of stuff, but it is advisable to do it in ComponentDidMount as per REACT docs/standards.

ComponentDidUpdate should be used when we want to do data reloading everytime there is change in state/props.

ComponentWillUnmount will be used mainly for some kind of cleanup.

See - Lifecycle-methods-with-desc.png

See - Rarely-used-lifecycle-methods.png

constructor(props){
            super(props);
            this.state = {
                lat: null,
                errorMessage: ''
            }
        }

can be written as 
state = {lat: null, errorMessage: ''}

because babel on it's own convert this line to constructor.
to confirm, visit babeljs.io, click on try it out and enable stage1, stage2, stage3, react.
Paste the code on LHS and see the converted version on RHS.

******************************************Section 7 - Handling user input with forms and events*************

See - App-mock-up.png
See - App-mock-up-v2.png
See - App-challenges.png
See - Components-diagram.png

onSubmit this->this
Cannot read property 'state' of undefined.

Solution1:
Another way of solving above issue is to use bind in constructor.
See - Fix-context-issues.png


Solution2: 
Use arrow function, this arrow function always consider this as class object. In  this case it is searchBar object.
See - Using-arrow-function.png

Solution3: 
Use arrow function while invoking onSubmit event.
See - Using-arrow-function-onsubmitEvent.png

******************************************Section 8 - Making API requests with React*************

See - Mockup-for-using-unplash-API.png

-------All about unsplash begin----------------

Unsplash is a company that provide API to return whatever we ask for, eg. If we ask for cars, it will send back list of car images matching our search criteria.

Creating account and appplication in unsplash
launch : https://unsplash.com/developers
Click on register as developer.
Join using facebook was not working, so create a new account.

Click on New Application 
Application Name: React Pics
Desc: This application is used to fetch pics

TO get root URI for unsplash, go to documentation.
click on schema -> location.

to know how to pass authorization header to unsplash.
Clik on documentation , Authorization.

To get access key 
Go to unsplash application that we had created, scroll down and pick the access key.

How to get specific car url that we want to use in out application.
Once made axios call to unspalsh, go to console->inspect->Network.
Clik on Get cars call, click on preview, Scroll down to see urls, select regular one and copy the URL.

Now click on documentation tab and click on search photos and understand on how to fetch images.




See - React-to-unspalsh-communication.png

-------All about unsplash end----------------

See - axios-vs-fetch.png

Always use axios with compared with fetch because if we use fetch we have to access very low level functions.
It also has corner case issues. axios has all inbuilt and easy to use.

npm install --save axios

import standards:
always put third party imports above user defined imports.

See - Application-flow.png

---------------------------------Asynchronous handling concept---------------

  onSearchSubmit(term) {
        axios.get(url, params, headers);		
  };
  
In above snipper, axios.get is an asynchronous call, so the function flow will go ahead and get will happen separately.
To handle this, we can call then on promise.

axios.get() returns a promise.We can add .then on promise to make this call synchronous and fetch the data after it completes.

So new code is 

  onSearchSubmit(term) {
        axios.get(url, params, headers).then(respone => {console.log(response)});		
  };

-----
Another way of solving above problem.

  async onSearchSubmit(term) {
        const response = await axios.get(url, params, headers);
		console.log(response);
  };
  
Aysnc await is a lot simpler to understand when compared with fetch.


-------------------------------------------Section 9 Building list of records---------------

See - For_Loop_verses_Map.png

We can improve performance in react by loading only that particular element in a list which has been modified.
We can do this by adding id attribute to the list, which should be unique for every element in the list.

See - Performance-improve-by-ID.png
See in above diagram only key=4 would be added from new rendered list to currently in the DOM object.

It won't rerender entire component in this case.

Note: Section 9 code is available in section-8 project in workspace folder.
